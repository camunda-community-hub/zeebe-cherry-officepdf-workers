# Zeebe Cherry Office PDF Workers


## Manage files (or documents)

Zeebe does not store files as it.
The Vercors project offers different approaches to manipulating files across workers.
For example, OfficeToPdf needs an MS office or an Open Office document as input and will produce a PDF document as a result.

How to give this document? How to store the result?

The Vercors project introduces the StorageDefinition concept. This information explains how to access files (same concept as a JDBC URL).
Then OfficeToPdf requied a sourceStorageDefinition, and a destinationStorageDefinition.
LoadFileFromDisk required a storageDefinition, and produced as output a "fileLoaded".
Note: the storage definition is the way to access where files are stored, not the file itself.

Existing storage definitions are:
* **JSON**: files are stored as JSON, as a process variable. This is simple, but if your file is large, not very efficient. The file is encoded in base 64, which implies a 20 to 40% overload, and the file is stored in the C8 engine, which may cause some overlap.

Example with LoadFileFromDisk:
````
storageDefinition: JSON
````
fileLoaded contains a JSON information with the file
````
{"name": "...", "mimeType": "application/txt", value="..."}
````

* **FOLDER:<path>**. File is store on the folder, with a unique name to avoid any collision.

Example with LoadFileFromDisk:
````
storageDefinition: FOLDER:/c8/fileprocess
````
fileLoaded contains
````
"contractMay_554343435533.docx"
````
Note: the folder is accessible by workers. If you run a multiple Vercors application on different hosts, the folder must be visible by all applications.

* **TEMPFOLDER**, the temporary folder on the host, is used to store the file, with a unique name to avoid any collision

Example with LoadFileFromDisk:
````
storageDefinition: TEMPFOLDER
````
fileLoaded contains
````
"contractMay_554343435533.docx"
````
This file is visible in the temporary folder on the host

Note: the temporary folder is accessible only on one host, and each host has a different temporary folder. This implies your workers run only on the same host, not in a cluster.
